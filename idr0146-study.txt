Study Title	Time lapse imaging of mesoderm and early cardiac progenitors in mouse embryos																																
Study Type	time-lapse imaging

Study Type Term Accession	OMIT_0027490																																
Study Description	Using four-dimensional whole-embryo light sheet imaging with improved and accessible computational tools, we longitudinally reconstruct early murine cardiac development at single-cell resolution. Nascent mesoderm progenitors form opposing density and motility gradients, converting the temporal birth sequence of gastrulation into a spatial anterolateral-to-posteromedial arrangement. Migrating precardiac mesoderm doesnâ€™t strictly preserve cellular neighbor relationships; spatial patterns only become solidified as the cardiac crescent emerges. Progenitors undergo a heretofore unknown mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition, with an anchored first heart field (FHF) ridge apposing a motile juxtacardiac field (JCF). The nascent heart tube forms as the JCF rotates forward, due to push-pull morphodynamics of the second heart field transmitted through the FHF epithelium. In Mesp1 mutants that fail to make a cardiac crescent, mesoderm remains highly motile but directionally incoherent, resulting in density gradient inversion. Our practicable live embryo imaging approach defines spatial origins and behaviors of cardiac progenitors, and identifies their unanticipated morphological transitions.
